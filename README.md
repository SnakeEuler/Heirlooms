# Game Structure

The timeline unfolds across three distinct eras:
    
Mythic Era: Legends are born, foundations are laid, and the seeds of destiny are sown.

Expansion Era: The family ventures forth, seeking fortune, power, or simply a new home.

Modern Era: The legacy of the past collides with the challenges and opportunities of the present.

# Player Roles

Each player assumes the role of a descendant, carrying the weight of their ancestors' choices. Your goal is to collaboratively weave a compelling narrative that spans generations, balancing triumph and tragedy, ambition and adversity.

# Events: 

2 Positive Events: These represent moments of triumph, discovery, or good fortune.
2 Catastrophes: These depict calamities, setbacks, or devastating losses.
1 Random Event: This will be rolled on the spot.

# Key Events

Each era features a set of predetermined Key Events, which serve as pivotal moments in history. These events shape the world around your family, providing context and opportunities for interaction.

# Prestige Points

Prestige represents your family's standing in society, reflecting their accomplishments, reputation, and influence.

Positive Events: Add +1 Prestige (base value).
Catastrophes: Subtract -1 Prestige (base value).
Karmic Events: Multiply the Prestige value of all connected events.

# Karmic Echo

When you play an Event that advances or amplifies another player's event, you trigger a Karmic Echo.

Create a New Event: A new event of the opposite type is generated in the next era.
Gain an Event: You receive an additional Event Card of the same type you played.

# Boons and Burdens

If an era concludes with negative Prestige, your family incurs a Burden in the following era, reflecting the lingering consequences of their past actions. However, they also receive a Boon, a unique advantage or opportunity born from adversity.

# Personalities

Each Event introduces or develops key personalities – heroes, villains, rivals, or allies – who shape your family's journey. These figures can become recurring characters in your campaign, their fates intertwined with your own.

# Game Flow    

Mythic Era: Begin by establishing the family's origin story, incorporating the two predetermined Key Events. Each player then takes turns playing one of their Event Cards, weaving their individual threads into the shared narrative.

Prestige Calculation: Once all Mythic Era events have been played, calculate the total Prestige. If positive, it becomes Renown in the Expansion Era. If negative, it becomes a Burden, but the family gains a Boon.

Expansion Era: Repeat the process, incorporating the three Expansion Era Key Events and eight Player-Driven Events.

Prestige Calculation: Calculate the total Prestige, factoring in any Renown or Burden from the previous era. If positive, it becomes Status in the Modern Era. If negative, it becomes a Burden, but the family gains a Boon.

Modern Era: Conclude the timeline with the four Modern Era Key Events and eight Player-Driven Events.

Legacy: The final Prestige calculation determines the family's ultimate legacy and standing in the world. Their story is complete, but their impact on the game world is just beginning.
