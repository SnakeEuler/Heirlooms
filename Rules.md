# Legacy System:


## Echoes
___
Source/Inspiration: Blades in the Dark - Flashbacks
Purpose: Offer a social/narrative option for solving a current problem by causing a Flashback. 


Characters begin each session with one Echo. Additionally, characters can accrue "Echoes" through significant events, whether personal triumphs, traumatic experiences, or encounters with elements tied to their backstory. Spending an Echo allows a player to narrate a flashback scene, potentially gaining:

- **Advantage on a roll:** Perhaps a past lesson applies to the present challenge.
- **A new piece of information:** A memory reveals a hidden detail or clue.
- **A moment of clarity:** The Flashback helps the character understand their motivations or emotions better.
- **A temporary boost:** A surge of adrenaline from reliving a past triumph provides a brief bonus.

# Clocks
___
Source: Blades in the Dark
Purpose: Tracking threads of narrative or various levels that go into completing a task or objective. 

# Stress & Trauma
___

Source: Blades in the Dark
Purpose: An expendable resource that is also a measure of mental health. Flashbacks or pushing your character on a roll adds to stress. High levels of stress eventually cause Trauma. 

The weight of experience is a tangible force, etching itself upon both body and mind. The Stress & Trauma system reflects this interconnectedness,

### Stress:
- **Essence:** Stress represents the physical and mental strain a character endures. It encompasses wounds, exhaustion, fear, grief, and the cumulative toll of life's hardships.
- **Starting Stress:** Determined by class and Constitution modifier, this value reflects a character's innate resilience and ability to withstand adversity. A hardy barbarian might boast a high starting Stress, while a scholarly wizard might have less.
- **Sources of Stress:**
    - **Combat:** Every wound, whether from a blade, a spell, or a monstrous claw, inflicts Stress. The DM determines the amount based on the severity of the injury.
    - **Terror and Trauma:** Witnessing horrific events, encountering terrifying creatures, or enduring personal tragedies can inflict deep psychological wounds, increasing Stress.
    - **Environmental Hazards:** Extreme cold, scorching heat, starvation, or exposure to toxins can wear down a character's body and mind, adding to their Stress.
    - **Magical Afflictions:** Certain spells or curses can directly target a character's well-being, draining their Stress and leaving them vulnerable.
- **Stress Recovery:** Rest is essential for recuperating from Stress. A long rest in a safe and comfortable environment can restore a significant amount of Stress. Additionally, magical healing, medical attention, or time spent engaging in calming activities like meditation or prayer can aid in recovery.

### Trauma
- **Essence:** When a character's Stress is pushed beyond their limits, they risk developing Trauma. Trauma represents lasting scars, both physical and psychological, that linger long after the initial injury or event.
- **Trauma Threshold:** When a character's Stress is reduced to 0 or below, they must make a Constitution saving throw (DC set by the DM). Failure indicates the onset of Trauma. The severity of the Trauma depends on how far below 0 their Stress fell.
- **Types of Trauma:**
    - **Physical:** These traumas manifest as lasting bodily harm, such as a limp, chronic pain, sensory loss, or a disfiguring scar. They may impose penalties on physical activities or require ongoing medical attention.
    - **Mental:** These traumas leave psychological scars, such as phobias, anxiety, depression, nightmares, or flashbacks. They can hinder social interactions, impair decision-making, or trigger debilitating panic attacks.
    - **Spiritual:** These traumas shake a character's faith, corrupt their soul, or leave them vulnerable to supernatural influence. They may manifest as a loss of divine favor, an inability to cast certain spells, or a susceptibility to possession.
- **Overcoming Trauma:** Healing from Trauma is a long and arduous journey. It may require specialized therapy, exposure therapy to confront fears, spiritual guidance, or embarking on a personal quest to address the root cause of the trauma. Overcoming Trauma is a significant accomplishment, representing not only physical and mental recovery but also personal growth and resilience.
# Beliefs & Instincts
___

Purpose: Help define character driven goals and narrative structure while offering actionable and in-game effects. 

Individuals are shaped by their deeply held Beliefs and innate Instincts. These personal convictions and intuitive reactions guide their choices, influence their interactions, and ultimately define who they are.

### Beliefs:

- **Essence:** A Belief is a fundamental truth or conviction that a character holds dear. It is a guiding principle that shapes their worldview, influences their decisions, and motivates their actions. Beliefs can be rooted in religion, philosophy, personal experience, or cultural tradition.
- **Prime Belief:** During character creation, each player chooses a single Prime Belief that is most central to their character's identity. This belief becomes a defining aspect of their personality and plays a crucial role in their personal journey.
- **Mechanical Benefits:**
    - **Inspiration:** When a character upholds their Prime Belief in a meaningful way, especially when facing adversity or temptation, they may be rewarded with Inspiration. This allows them to reroll a failed ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.
    - **Divine Favor (for religious Beliefs):** Characters whose Prime Belief is rooted in faith may receive divine favor in the form of guidance, protection, or even minor miracles.

### Instincts:

- **Essence:** An Instinct is an inherent tendency or talent that a character possesses. It is an intuitive response or a knack for certain skills, often linked to their class, background, or upbringing. Instincts can manifest as gut feelings, flashes of insight, or a natural aptitude for specific tasks.
- **Mechanical Benefits:**
    - **Advantage:** When a character acts on their Instinct in a relevant situation, they may gain advantage on an ability check or attack roll.
    - **Skill Proficiencies:** Some Instincts may grant proficiency in a specific skill, reflecting the character's innate talent or training.
# Vice & Nature
___

Purpose: Codify emotional traits that can be used to promote narrative for the character. 

In the complex landscape of the human heart, Vice and Nature intertwine, shaping a character's actions, motivations, and ultimately their destiny.

### Vice:

- **Essence:** Vice represents a character's weakness, a flaw that tempts them towards impulsive or harmful behavior. It could be an addiction, a deep-seated fear, a burning jealousy, or an insatiable greed. Vice is a constant companion, whispering in the character's ear, urging them to succumb to their darkest desires.
- **Mechanical Consequences:**
    - **Stress Accumulation:** When a character gives in to their Vice, they may gain additional Stress, reflecting the toll that their actions take on their body and mind.
    - **Social Repercussions:** Indulging in Vice can damage relationships, tarnish reputations, and create conflict with others.
    - **Narrative Opportunities:** Vice creates opportunities for drama, internal conflict, and character development. Players can explore the consequences of their choices and the challenges of overcoming their weaknesses.

### Nature:

- **Essence:** Nature is a character's strength, a virtue that guides them towards noble actions and helps them resist temptation. It could be courage, compassion, loyalty, or a sense of justice. Nature is a beacon of hope, reminding the character of their potential for good and inspiring them to strive for greatness.
- **Mechanical Benefits:**
    - **Stress Reduction:** Acting in accordance with their Nature can help a character reduce their Stress, reflecting the positive impact of virtuous behavior on their well-being.
    - **Social Rewards:** Upholding their Nature can earn a character respect, admiration, and trust from others.
    - **Narrative Opportunities:** Nature provides opportunities for heroism, self-sacrifice, and personal growth. Players can explore the rewards of living a virtuous life and the impact their choices have on the world around them.
