In the Unending Before...

There was naught but the Nur, a vast, swirling chaos where all things mingled as one. No light, no shadow, no form, no thought.  Yet within this formlessness, a seed of arrogance sprouted, and the Nur gave birth to the first people, the nurăθaθalanahă.

Gifted with cunning hands and curious minds, they shaped the Nur into a paradise, a gleaming garden where every desire was met. But their hearts grew swollen with pride. They turned their tools not to creation, but to dominion, seeking to bend the Nur to their every whim.

And so, the Nur, wounded and enraged, tore asunder the paradise they had built. The world shattered, fragments hurled into the abyss, and from the wreckage, a new universe was born.

The Threefold Tapestry

Three realms emerged from the chaos, woven together like threads of a cosmic tapestry.

The first was Angìmì, a verdant sphere shaped like the wild eggplant, suspended in a boundless sea without water. Here, humans were to dwell, their lives intertwined with the cycles of nature and the creatures of the land.

The second was the Unseen Sea, a realm of shimmering energy and swirling mists. Here, the gods made their abode, their whispers carried on the wind, their powers shaping the currents of fate.

Between these two lay the third realm, the Whispering Veil, a bridge between the seen and the unseen. It was a realm of dreams and memories, where the souls of the living danced with the spirits of the ancestors.

The Promise of Rebirth

Yet, even in anger, the Nur remembered its love for its children. It gathered the shattered remnants of the nurăθaθalanahă, weaving them into eight tiny seeds. Four were nestled deep within the rainforest of a towering mountain range, overlooking a vast river basin. The other four found refuge in the fertile delta on the opposite shore.

These seeds were a promise, a hope for a new beginning. Within the embrace of the earth, they would slumber, nourished by the lifeblood of the land, until the time was ripe for them to awaken and fulfill their destiny.

The land was fertile, warm, and humid, a cradle for new life. And so, the cycle began anew, a dance of creation and destruction, of arrogance and humility, forever woven into the fabric of the universe.
