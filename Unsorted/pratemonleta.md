[[pratemon]] is the term for an individuals journey through late childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood; usually considered between the ages of 7 - 19.

The choosing of a gender and accountment at the [[pratemonleta]] was a integral point in the life of any [[naθeþan]]. It was said that after a child chose, the [[otmanelasa]] was then a [[xaxt'a]] or gift. 

Once the [[xaxt'a]] was received and the ceremonial words spoken, the individual passed into the second stage of their [[pratemon]] and was no longer allowed to live or communicate with the wider culture or family. 

This was because the choice of [[otmanelasa]] also carried a determination of vocation, living arrangements, education, and uniform.  c

This practice was supported and maintained as a means for each member of the culture to contribute and understand something significant to  greater society. Referred to as [[nuranakapa ad’ar aptatona]], meaning 'their eyes are raised'.
