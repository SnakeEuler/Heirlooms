[[tsamahariθaxat]] is the primary water way and river system, included a single river of the same name, that encompasses the [[luhă]] basin. The [[luhă]] basin is a collection of basins that dominate the valley of [[naþamăqat]].
The river discharges a massive volume of water into the ocean per day, roughly around 215,000 m^3/s and has 22 major individual tributaries. The [[luhă]] basin is the largest drainage basin world wide. 

The river flows from west to east and discharges into the [[Tedelana Sogara]] or Shimmering Ocean. 

The course of the river flows from the most distant point on peak [[tsamaq'uza]] on the opposite side of the continent. 

The mouth of the river is host to a number of large islands which were home to the [[umìšdăgal]] people before they integrated into [[Aluhăgal]] culture. Settlements still thrive there. The estuary is nearly 330 km wide. 

Bridges have been historically difficult to maintain and often times seemed futile to the people of the region, who preferred boat, ferry, and other water craft to traverse the water.
