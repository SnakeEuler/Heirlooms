The [[tiragaqă]] is a medium sized short eared canine that is revered for a mane and underbelly coat of long, fine hair that is shorn and woven or felted, known as  [[darjă]] . Hair can also be harvested from the back and tail, though this is of a different quality, known as [[ibjă]], better suited for dense, tough textiles. The [[mašambeþan]] spend some of their time during the rainy seasons processing stockpiles of fibers that have been collected during the year.
