 [[luhă]] is the name of the greater valley and connected lower regions. It begins at the northwest coastal edge of the [[qilinaq'a]] mountains with the northern border continuing west along the ridgeline, extends to the southern tip of the [[naþamăqat]] landmass and incorporates the south eastern island chain. 

The northern valley consists of three major drainage basins with the largest and most prominent being [[tsamahariθaxat]] and its tributaries. The highest point in the watershed is the second highest peak of the [[qilinaq'a]] mountains, [[tsamaq'uza]], which ascends over 6000 meters above sea level. The other two rivers are the [[anzuhuimiq'a]] and [[ìlarhad'a]]. 

On the lee side of the mountains, the [[luhă]] has a low-water or summer season called  [[adera alaxpaden]]  , and a wet or winter season called [[adera tsisesen]]. Through both seasons the average temperature is 78 degrees Fahrenheit and is humid in the north around the rivers and into the rainforests. The low lands gradually get hotter in the south averaging 88  F in steppe and reaching up to 110 F in the dried riverbed deserts.  

Seasonal floods excavate and redistribute nutrient-rich silt onto beaches and islands, enabling [[adera alaxpaden]] riverside agriculture of [[mat]], [[yasa]], and [[amagura]] on the river's shoreline without the addition of fertilizer and with additional slash and burn agriculture on higher floodplains. Fishing provides additional food year-round, and free-range birds ([[tsikilmas]], [[xalpa]], [[tsue]], and [[enkuki]]) needed little or no food beyond what they could forage locally. Charcoal made largely from forest and shoreline deadfall is produced for use in urban areas.
