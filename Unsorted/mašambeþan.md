During the Neolithic period [[mašambeþan]]  families lived in small multi-generational cliques and were closely connected with several nearby. Friendly competition between families helped bind the once disparate peoples into loosely aligned regional communities. 

Reproductive/romantic pairings between the younger generations were often the center of social life. During this foundational time, a highly complex courtship system emerged. This system helped keep tensions or disputes between families to a minimum and allowed for the sharing of cultural knowledge over time. Though there was no codified hierarchy, it was generally observed that the elders and families who lived deepest in the heart of the mountainous rainforest were revered and honored. 

[[mašambeþan]] families would move and build a new semi-permanent house every year after seasonal flooding. Families would pack important belongings and make the arduous trip to sacred and protected areas high up and deep into the mountain range. This is a time for great celebration and major holidays are held as the society bands together. Not all of the families travel to the same place, but only a few large areas were available to relocate to. Food would be brought and shared to the whole community. A system of cultivated caves shaped by generations of families served to act as living quarters for each family. Many coming of age ceremonies, marriages, and dispute settlements were held during this time.
