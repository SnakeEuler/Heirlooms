 Early [[naθeþan]] culture developed into having flexible concepts of gender that would be key to defining much of the character of the group as a whole. 
 
 The [[otmanelasa]] was modal, fluid, and changing from one to another was accepted as the sacred right of an individual. There were four primary genders:
	1. [[ese]]
	2. [[otma]]
	3. [[aθ]]
	4. [[ame]]

During [[pratemonleta]], a coming of age ceremony usually observed around ages 7 to 8, allowed for an individual to declare their chosen gender and for all to celebrate and honor that decision.
