the [[qilinaq'a]] are the predominant mountain range in [[naþamăqat]] and make up the longest continental mountain range in the world forming a crescent around the west, northwest, north, and partially northeast coast. It has an average height of 4000 m and varies from 200 to 700 km wide. 

Along their length the qilinaq'a are divided into several ranges separated by intermediate depressions. Qilinaq'a are the location of several plateaus and tepuis that house large habitats and settlements. The ranges are grouped into four major divisions: the [[Rìštalinaq'a]] or The Greatest, [[Ad'aqilinaq'a]] or The Living, [[Mekulinaq'a]] or The Bladed, and the [[Eskilinaq'a]]or The Proud.

Extremely high volcanoes exist within the ranges on of which rises to 6,893 m. 

Qilinaq'a host large ore and salt deposits in the [[Gamun]] desert within the [[Eskilinaq'a]] division to the south some of the largest mineralizations of copper occur in the world and played a key role in the development of metal technologies. Additionally two salars, or dried lake beds, in the region are home to large sources of lithium and a tin belt. 

The mountains span across several natural and floristic regions. Rainforests and tropical try forests dominate the north and north east. Relatively dry slopes on the coastal side of western mountains, deciduous woodland, shrub and xeric vegetation cover them. 

###### Notable Plantlife
[[timkuqa]] (tobacco), [[ts'iqi]](potato), and [[mìnasenake]](chili peppers) are prominent crops across the area. 

###### Notable Fauna
The [gurasišard] and [adilarokšasa] can be found living in the [[Rìštalinaq'a]], while the closely related domesticated [tsizamikimidemune] and [empanimxa] are widely kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool. The crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk) [telesìnoasa] inhabit all regions.[31][32] The qiliniq'a [maopopaθ], the largest bird of its kind in the world. Other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high qilinaq'a include the [sanagarani], [naro], [orogekuk], [gošokoraut] and, for birds, certain species of podo, imote, tetaìmote, [qutemìetegora] (mainly associated with hypersaline lakes), [aþiampar], [lolepela], [penq], [mìlketnilalane], [genemakša].

[[tsrestal]] lake hosts several endemics, among them the highly piculiar [ìspìuimp’ena], or mirror jumping bird, and [goenotagora] a giant frog-like amphibian. A few species of hummingbirds, notably [qilixaraxara], can be seen at altitudes above 4,000 m (13,100 ft), but far higher diversities can be found at lower altitudes, especially in the humid forests ("cloud forests") growing on slopes. These forest-types are very rich in flora and fauna, although few large mammals exist, exceptions being the tapir, [lalao], [axantas] bear, and [aqademoladeiþiga], a type of monkey.

Birds of humid Andean forests include mountain [amad'e], [ts'ala] and the [paluma] , while mixed species flocks dominated by [taria] birds and [tsog] commonly are seen – in contrast to several vocal but typically cryptic species of [quguma], [makol] and [adede].
