Early Neolithic [[naθeþan]] culture was born of nomadic hunter gatherer tribes settling in the lowland areas of the [[luhă]] valley, river islands, and river banks. Known for advancement in agriculture, particularly of plants and maintaining farming near the flooding river planes. Thought of as a matriarchal society, a defining feature of their cultural group is [[otmanelasa]] and the presence of four genders as well as fluidity and personal modality within. Highly ceremonial and structural, members of this group performed a portion of mandatory service years in specific professions that directly contributed to maintaining the society as a whole. After a citizens tenure of labor they would be accepted into the central cultural areas to live freely as they saw fit, having 'paid' for the continuation of society. 

Harvesting textiles and fabrics, mostly in the form of [[manq]], was central to spiritual and social life. 

The [[naθeþan]] culture arose from the farming communities on the south river bank and basin and excelled in the use of cultivated plants, fiber weaving, structural engineering of homes and physical communities, logistics, and ceramics. Additionally, [[naθeþan]] engineering saw the development of reed boats up to the creation of a double hull or double canoe. 

[[naθeþan]] make use of bast fibers from a large native flowering plant, [[egete]], to make a thick paper-like material. Their major contributor to fabric for clothing and practical uses, comes from the harvesting of a domesticated plant [[ansavmanq'a]]. It produces a delicate but resilient fabric similar to linen simply called [[manq]]. 

##### SETTLEMENTS
___
[[naθeþan]] settlements were structured around large centralized communal housing complexes. These central areas were composed of several large long houses raised off the ground on stilts with long angled roofs to both shield from sun exposure and allow for funneling wind through to keep cool during  hot summer months. A bazaar, trade, and community area would mark the center of the entire settlement and often have permanent structure additions of some kind. Outside the domicile and social area walls, barriers and terracing separated this area from the farms, livestock fields, and worker settlements. 

##### Relations
First made contact with the [[umìšdăgal]] and established trade. This was crucial to the development of [[arnaqasena neq’e]] or "screaming mud" which was cultivated in their territory and allowed for high quality strong ceramics to be fired at much lower temperatures.
