[[mìþhanaq]] is a low tepui plateau with access to both [[lalkano]], a trap rock that is extremely dense and of high quality, and easily quarried [[lokim]], a granite like stone with very high weather resistance. The site was sacred to the [[mašambeþan]] people and they first settled and discovered the natural resources there. A fortified structure was first built by the founding families but has been rebuilt, expanded, and improved over many generations in the hands of various cultural groups.
