The [[umìšdăgal]] were a nomadic group of settlers to the [[luhă]] and arrived after most major agricultural shifts had taken place within the native populations. The circumstances around their arrival have remained an historical mystery for the inhabitants of the world. 

Initially, a small population and cultural weariness kept them at odds with the other peoples of the region.

##### Relations
Initially, a small population and cultural weariness kept them at odds with the other peoples of the region. After a short time the [[naθeþan]] began to communicate and showed interested in opening trade between them.

[[umìšdăgal]] would use the [[naθeþan]] traded sediments to extract copper for metal works that were key to the early development of metallurgy. 

The [[umìšdăgal]] had a rare knowledge they carried with them until death. It was only passed down to their closest of kin. As a reward for offering them sanctuary, they taught the [[mašambeþan]] the craft of metal forging with copper.
