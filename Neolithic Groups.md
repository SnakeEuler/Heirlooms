##### First Peoples

Originally two main groups inhabited the [[luhă]] valley. In the high, thickly forested and mountainous regions, an egalitarian, multi-generation social structure was dominant. These were the [[mašambeþan]]. 

The river plains and low hills were inhabited by a second group, the [[naθeþan]], whose culture centered around agriculture and domesticity. 

As these groups grew and developed and expand their territory, they slowly began to communicate and influence each other. Trade followed and it wasn't long before mixed customs began to span both groups. 

One key custom saw that [[mašambeþan]] children who came of age would partake in the [[pratemonleta]] in exchange for the arrangement of marriage to a [[naθeþan]] once their term was served. 


##### Nomadic settlers 
During this time when [[mašambeþan]] and [[naθeþan]] where becoming less distinct from one another a new group of people appeared at the delta of the [[tsamahariθaxat]] and settled on the central island in the delta. They were the [[umìšdăgal]].

##### Group relations
[[naθeþan]] and [[umìšdăgal]] were quick to establish a positive relationship strengthened by trade. 

The [[mašambeþan]] peoples were much more hesitant to welcome newcomers. Their emphasis on family and heredity made them culturally weary and even protective of the [[naθeþan]] who they saw as one and the same. 

Tensions grew when the [[umìšdăgal]] migrated into [[mašambeþan]] territory after unseasonal flooding pushed them out of their island home. The [[naθeþan]] advocated had to intervene when a dispute lead to the deaths of unarmed [[umìšdăgal]] seeking shelter in a deep forest cairn. A lengthy standoff followed and days of fruitless attempts lead to more friction among the people. It wasn't until the relatively unwise newcomers accidentally poisoned their own food and water while trying to forage that a path was laid. The sickness was overwhelming and nearly one in three [[umìšdăgal]] died within three days. The [[mašambeþan]] took mercy on the remaining ranks, offering medicine, training, and allowing the remaining few to take new homes in their sacred caves amid the north tepui's height. 

The [[umìšdăgal]] had a secret knowledge they carried with them only passed down to their closest of kin. As a reward for offering them sanctuary, they taught the [[mašambeþan]] the craft of metal forging with copper as well as the magics that need it as a cost to perform.
